# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `UpsertOptions.MatchBy` — optional `LambdaExpression` that overrides primary-key default-value detection with a custom business-key lookup. Supports single-property (`e => e.ExternalId`) and anonymous composite (`e => new { e.TenantId, e.ExternalId }`) shapes. Winnow performs one batched `SELECT` (`AsNoTracking`, chunked, parameter-budget-aware) before `SaveChanges` to partition the input batch into insert/update sets. On update, the resolved row's primary key and concurrency-token values are copied onto the input entity so the subsequent `Modified` flip generates a correct UPDATE under optimistic concurrency.
- `UpsertOptionsExtensions.WithMatchBy<TEntity, TKey>` — fluent helper for type-safe construction of the `MatchBy` expression.
- `DuplicateKeyStrategy.RetryAsUpdate` is now MatchBy-aware: when a concurrent INSERT lands between the pre-SELECT and our save, the retry path re-queries by business key, copies the now-existing row's primary key + concurrency tokens, and re-issues as UPDATE.

### Notes

- Graph upsert (`UpsertGraph`) does not yet support `MatchBy`; the property is exposed on `UpsertOptions` only.
- Ambiguous matches (multiple existing rows for the same match key) and duplicate match keys within a single input batch are rejected with `InvalidOperationException` — Winnow does not silently pick a winner.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- `ResultDetail` enum (`None`, `Minimal`, `Full`) and matching `WinnowOptions.ResultDetail` / `GraphOptionsBase.ResultDetail` properties to control how much per-entity detail batch results capture. Lower levels suppress reporting-only collections (entity references, exception object references, graph hierarchy, traversal statistics) and reduce memory for large batches. `SuccessCount`, `FailureCount`, `Duration`, and `TotalRetries` remain accurate at every level.
- Internal accumulator infrastructure (`InsertAccumulator`, `WinnowAccumulator`, `UpsertAccumulator`, `GraphResultAccumulator`, `AccumulatorFactory`) that centralises allocation gating; the accumulator pattern replaces ad-hoc bool flags previously scattered across operation classes.
- New `ResultDetailBenchmarks` quantifying allocation reduction at each detail level.

### Changed

- Result accessors now throw `InvalidOperationException` when their data was suppressed by a lower `ResultDetail` than they require. Default behaviour is preserved (`ResultDetail.Full`), so existing callers see no change. The exception message names the required level, the configured level, and the always-available alternative property where one exists.
- `UpsertResult.GetByIndex` now uses an O(1) dictionary cache (previously an O(n) linear scan over a concatenated list).

### Performance

- Memory savings of roughly 17–19% on `InsertGraph` workloads when callers opt into `ResultDetail.Minimal` or `ResultDetail.None`, by skipping the recursive `GraphHierarchy` tree and `TraversalInfo` statistics. Flat operations see negligible change since EF Core's change tracker dominates allocation there. See the per-provider benchmark docs for numbers.
